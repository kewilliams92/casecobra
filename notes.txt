For this project, I am using uploadThing for the upload management. It is a simple and easy to use package that allows you to upload files to the server. It also provides a progress bar to show the progress of the upload.

However, if this was production project that I build for myself or a client, I would use 
Amazon S3 for the file storage. It is a scalable, secure, and reliable storage solution that is perfect for storing files. It also has a robust API that allows you to easily integrate it into your application.
Or cloudflare for the file storage. It is a content delivery network that can store and deliver files to users quickly and efficiently. It also has a robust API that allows you to easily integrate it into your application.

Reasons:
1.  uploadthing doesn't require a credit card to use, so it is a good option for small projects or for testing purposes. However, it is not as scalable or reliable as Amazon S3 or cloudflare.
2.  uploadthing makes it much easier to get started and start uploading files. It is a simple and easy to use package that is perfect for beginners or for small projects.
